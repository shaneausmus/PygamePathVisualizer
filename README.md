# Pygame Path Visualizer

This pathfinding visualizer was a project I took on to learn more about Pygame and pathfinding / graph-traversal algorithms generally. Currently, the program has options supporting A*, DFS, BFS, and a variant of bidirectional search. The program also supports placing obstacles, and is interactive.

Future updates include support to visualize additional algorithms and updates to the GUI.
